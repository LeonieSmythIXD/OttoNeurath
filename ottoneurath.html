        <p> Otto Neurath was arguably the most important influence on how we communicate today with icons especially through education. With this, my essay will focus on the creation of picture language, how Isotype system came about and the influence it has on modern design today.</p>

        <h2 id="history">History</h2>
        
        <p> Otto Neurath (1882-1945) was an Austrian philosopher, economist, and social scientist. When he was younger, Neurath was interested in how ideas and information could be shown in visual ways. Neurath was inspired by Egyptian wall art and hieroglyphics as well diagrams and illustrations he seen is his father’s books growing up. Following World War I, Neurath felt that the social and economic changes during this time needed better and more clear communication to help public understanding of important social issues relating to housing, health and economics. A system of pictographs to show complex statistical data was developed. His charts were fully functional and simple decorative qualities.
            
            Neurath was shortly involved with the new typography movement. Jan Tschichold helped him and his collaborators briefly in the late 1920s. Renner’s new Futura typeface was also brought in for the Isotype designs immediately after the typeface became commercial. Originally called the Vienna Method, the name Isotype which stands for International System of Typographic Picture Education, was changed after Neurath’s move to Holland in 1934.</p>

   <h2 id="the-transformation-team">The Transformation Team</h2>
      <p> The transformation team which was headed by scientist and mathematician Marie Reidermeister (1898-1959), took verbal and numerical data and changed it into layout form. These layouts where then given to graphic artists for final execution. The pictographs were initially drawn individually or cut from paper. Woodcut artist Gerd Arntz (1900-1988), whose prints included archetypal geometric figures, joined the transformation team in 1928, with him designing most of the pictographs. These pictographs were designed to show depictions of imagery such as a drunken man, an unemployed man, or an emigrant man in chart and diagram form. Arntz cut the pictographs on linoleum blocks, then they were printed on a letterpress and then they were placed into the final artwork. An inventory of 1140 pictographs were designed and printed by 1940. </p>

        <h2 id="rudolf-modley">Rudolf Modley</h2>
        
        <p> Rudolf Modley (1906-1976) was one of Otto Neurath’s many assistants, Modley came to America to the Isotype team during the 1930’s and established Pictorial Statistics, Inc. The name later changed to Pictographic Corporation, this then became the North American branch of the Isotype movement. Modley believed that symbols should follow the principles of good design and be effective in both smaller and larger sizes, and to function well as a unit for counting. The group contributed to the visual communication aspect by developing the formal use of the picture language. Including a system of connected images that would create an ordered structure and meaning to the images. As well as the design of simple pictographs. Their work had a big impact on post World War II graphics and visual design with their development of universal visual language systems and the continuing use of the pictographs in signage and information systems. I agree with this as during the second World War, Nazi Germany invaded France in 1939, which lead to the capture and imprisonment of the Jewish Communities within France and were threatened by German occupation which lead to many families moving across the southern border to Spain to avoid being captured. Post war this could have created a social miscommunication, so therefore I believe it had a big impact and was vital to have an easier form of communication for everyone involved.</p>

        <h2 id="development-of-the-modern-infographic">Development of the Modern Infographic</h2>
        
        <p>It can be easily argued who or what influenced the modern infographic. From as early as cave paintings from 30,000 BC depicting simple animals and people, to visual data communication scientists of the 1800s. I believe that Otto Neurath played a heavy role in the early development of the modern infographic. Looking at the evident success of Neurath’s pictographs, as seen around the early 1930s, Neurath partnered with the Mundanuem in the hopes to make his work internationally known. This soon came with success of having branches of his design studio form in places such as Berlin, London, and New York. Even after his unexpected death in 1945, his wife, Marie continued his legacy creating a vast number of children’s books using Isotypes, creating an influence in teaching practises across the world. With the continuation and success of Neurath’s legacy, I think his pictographs helped further the ongoing development of the infographic. </p>
